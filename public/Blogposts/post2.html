								<p>Wow, almost two weeks since the last time I posted something. Oof, keeping this up is more difficult than I imagined. Well here I am again, with some more updates about (of course) Wine Tastings, some great hikes, my first surfing experience and a bunch of meetings with people from the Netherlands, who just happen to be in the area. Also, I will show you more pictures of South African sunsets; nothing screams wannabe photographer like a good sunset picture.</p>

								<p>So, that's it for the sunsets. What have I been up to these past two weeks? Well, as introduced above, I got to meet some Dutch friends of mine! My last blogpost brought it to some peoples attention that I am currently here, and so they decided to let me know! First there was Jurjen, good friend of mine from primary school. Yeah, that's a long time ago, we couldn't exactly figure out how long we hadn't seen each other, but it had to have been close to eight years or so. So obviously, when you're both on the other side of the world, THAT is when you go meet eachother. Strange really, but we had quite a nice dinner and catch up talk! </p>

								<p>So, the next day, we are in a bar downtown to see a nice live-band, and by complete accident I run into Zita, a fellow Innovation student from Utrecht together with her sister. Granted, I did know they were in Stellenbosch, but we hadn't made any arrangements yet. So there in that bar seemed like a good time to do that, so 'of course' we decided we needed to do some winetasting, what else. Then finally on Sunday, I met two people I know from my highschool, one of them just started an internship in Cape Town, the other here to visit him on a holiday. Obviously, since they were coming to Stellenbosch from Cape Town, we needed to taste some wines. So we did. It was nice.</p>

									</div>
								</div>
								<p>So, besides meeting dutch people and drinking wines, what have I been up to? Well, I've done quite a bit of hiking. One hike up Simonsberg. It's the mountain you see in the pictures from around our estate. Since we have such a prominent view of it from our house, I figured I really did need to climb it. That definitely did result in some amazing views, but it was a darn tough climb. Also tried my hand at surfing for the first time, at the famous Muizenberg beach. Very nice beach, surfing is still very much a work in progress. And today I did a very long but impressive hike across the Jonkershoek Nature Reserve. An absolutely extraordinary piece of nature where you can walk for hours without hearing a single thing besides your own footsteps and some birds. It's also supposed to have some of the most amazing views, but we got to see very little of them, because it was very foggy, rainy and actually darn cold up top. Who would've thought? Rain and cold, in Africa. crazy. The picture on the right does give a bit of an impression of what it looks like though. <a href="/gallery.html">There's more pictures here,</a> if you're interested.

								<p>So, that's what I have mostly done in my free time here in Stellenbosch. Other noteworthy things: 1) I decided to rent a car, long term. Turns out that transport in SA is still a lot harder than you'd think, so I now have a lovely little Hyundai to drive me around. 2) I am currently planning a roadtrip to Port Elizabeth and the Addo Elephant National Park over easter. I met two nice internationals living in Muizenberg who are willing to join me. So yeah, will be staying in the 2nd largest Nature reserve of SA for a night, and traveling along the coast for the rest of the weekend. I promise I will send an update of that when I return, pinky promise, for real this time. Again, if you want to receive a reminder of that: you can leave your e-mail address behind <a href="/about.html#mail">here</a>. Seriously, don't let me go through the trouble of setting up this mailing list for only three people. No, I'm joking. I was actually surprised by the amount of people who did sign up. I mean, who uses e-mail these days? Thanks for reading, all! I will come back to you soon(ish).</p>
