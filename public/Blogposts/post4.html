								<p>Oof, this is almost getting embarrassing now. I’m still alive, don’t worry, but I bet I’m gonna have to come up with some excuses now:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>My family visited me</li>
									<li>Had to be the private tourguide of my friend Jordi who came over</li>
									<li>A dog, or a baboon, no wait, a LION ate my website, or something</li>
									<li>Our internet was down for a while (this one is actually true, sort of)</li>
									<li>I've been busy? I guess?</li>
								</ul>

								<p>Okay, let’s keep it at that. So yeah, I said it last time, I’ll begin writing ‘now now’. So I feel like I’ve now explained to you what that means here.</p>

								<p>Shortly after my last blogpost my family arrived along with Sabrina, a good friend of my sister (hereafter together referred to as family, because I feel that Sabrina has earned that position, and also because it is a lot easier). Really interesting experience to see them again. It simultaneously feels like ages ago that you’ve seen each other, but it also seems like yesterday. “Time is relative I guess” - A. Einstein, 1918. Obviously, the first thing to do was make some plans for what to do during the week, as I’d gotten some extra days of from my internship. So, inspired by my last blogpost, and the pictures, the family was very excited about doing a sunrise Lion’s Head hike. And since I really enjoyed it last time, and I always enjoy getting up at 4 AM in the morning, that was one of the first things we settled on to do during the week. So let’s do it this coming Friday someone suggested, the skies will be completely clear then! (more on that later).
								</p>
								<p>While I still took some days to work while they were here, while the family was doing the proper tourist experience (robben island, safari, etc.) it was pretty nice to have a few extra days off to play the tour guide as well. I quite enjoyed showing the family around, pretending to be a local. Which works a lot better when you're dealing with your family from the Netherlands. I really don't think I've ever been able to fool a South African to think that I am from the area. No matter how often I try to say 'Howzit?' in the most casual manner. So, obviously we went to see the penguins, we visited Cape Point (I hadn't been there myself yet, absolutely gorgeous Nature Reserve) and we went up Table Mountain. I still owe my parents a slight apology for quite grossly underestimating how challenging that climb can be. But they both bravely conquered the climb! Up top, obviously the views are gorgeous (you really don't get tired of them) and we got to see a lot of 'DASSIES!', which Rian found very exciting!

								<p>So, as mentioned, we also decided to redo the nice sunrise hike of Lion's Head. In theory a great idea. But let's just say that this time.... It didn't quite pan out as nicely as last time. The thing is: If you go up once, and the sky is perfectly clear and the sunrise is absolutely beautiful. You would almost forget that Cape Town actually very rarely has completely clear sky. So yes, we got very lucky the first time, and this time.... Not so much. Again, I feel like I need to apologize somewhat for forgetting how challenging the climb actually is (it's short, but it really is quite difficult. Proud of you, mom, dad! XD). And yeah, sunrise didn't really happen this time. Mostly clouds. Still quite nice and refreshing, and even got some pretty cool pictures.</p>

								<p>Now, basically before I knew it the family left again. At which point I had a very short existential crisis realizing that I was now over the halfway point of my stay here. And before I could say 'Blogpost' (or well, at least before I had time to write the thing) the next visitor was on the doorstep! Jordi came to visit, my fellow student, ex-roommate and I guess what you'd call friend, in english. Considering that Jordi had already been in Cape Town for a week last year, on the same study tour that introduced me to this place, we could skip most of the 'core experiences' that I went through with the family. So we decided to use the first weekend to see some more of the western cape, and see some of the things that I skipped during my earlier roadtrip. Not the least of which included hurling ourselves of a 200m high bridge. Pretty cool experience! What is it like, you're asking? It's really what you'd expect. It feels like you're falling to your death for about two seconds and then you feel that your feet are attached to a rope. And then you dangle there like a fish on a hook until you get hoisted up again. Pretty exciting!</p>

									Besides that craziness, we saw some of the Knysna forests, Mosselbay, some of Tsitsikamma national park. Stayed in some ridiculously beautiful B&B's. And back in Stellenbosch we obviously had some wines, did a nice long hike and went to the amazing township theater called Amazink. Pretty cool restaurant theater setup in the township of Stellenbosch, with good food, and incredibly talented local performers. Great theater/music/comedy/variety act. Besides that, we went to Cape Town a few times. Once more we went up Lion's Head (at sunset this time, and without clouds. Sorry, fam) All in all, a pretty good week! 
								</p>
								<p>
									So, to finish this thing of now, a few small things: 1) I've started reading a book in Afrikaans. Kringe in 'n bos by Dalene Matthee. One of the classics of Afrikaans literature. Pretty interesting so far, but reading is slow in Afrikaans. 2) It's properly becoming winter here now. The rains have quite properly started, which is very good, and the nights are getting bloody cold. So yes, the tables have turned, now you guys in the Netherlands have the better weather. 3) People are quite excited for the Fifa World cup here. South Africa didn't qualify, but that doesn't stop them from being excited, probably unlike in the Netherlands. A few Uber drivers have quite enthusiastically told me that they will definitely be supporting the Netherlands this year, quickly followed by me shattering their illusions.
								</p>
								<p>
									So, that's it for me. I'll just stop promising a new update anytime soon now. I'll most likely be pretty busy in this last month and with stressing out over all the things I still want to do before I go back to the Netherlands. Because really, it is only one more month. Crazy...
