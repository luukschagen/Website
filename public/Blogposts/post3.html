								<p>Yes, it has been a while again. Multiple reasons for that. Reason 1) I have been quite busy, a 4 day roadtrip, some hikes, trying not to get walked over by elephants, work, a middle of the night adventure to see a sunrise (because sunsets are soo three weeks ago). Reason 2) I kinda broke my website, so it took me some time to restore some things... You know, I'm still learning here.</p>
								<p>So these three weeks have been pretty eventful, which means I would have quite a lot to tell you, but I've been told that pictures say more than a thousand words, which saves me 24 thousand words by just giving you these links:</p>
								<ul class='actions'>
									<li><a href="/gallery2.html" class="button big">Pictures</a></li>
									<li><a href="/gallery.html" class="button big">More Pictures</a></li>
								</ul>
								<p>That first link mostly shows pictures from the roadtrip to Port Elizabeth along the garden route and the following visit to the Addo Elephant Nature Reserve. And the second is of the following trip back (with more sunset pictures, I'm sorry, South African sunsets are just too nice) and some activities during the last few weeks.</p>
								<p>I decided that with the long easter weekend, I should make good use of those extra free days to see some of the area outside of Stellenbosch and Cape Town. So I decided that it might finally be time for me to go out and meet some internationals to join me. How? Yeah, it took a while for me to figure that out too. Couchsurfing brought the solution. Originally a platform for people who are looking for places to sleep in other cities and people offering their couches, which is now apparently also used for internationals all over the world to meet each other. The internet, great stuff. So that's how I met two girls, both working in Cape Town for a while, from Czech and Germany respectively, Marcela and Jasmin. Who, by coincidence were planning to do a very similar trip, but needed someone to drive them. So I met them, we had a good dinner, made the plans and I introduced them to the hero of our story: my Hyundai i10, hereafter referred to as Hedwig (after being asked by like 4 people indipendently of eachother what the name of my car was... So this appears to be a thing now).</p>

								<p>Back in Stellenbosch I was politely warned that I should be careful going on a trip with people I hadn't met before, I quote: "It has been known to happen that people harvest your organs for ritual purposes". I figured that Marcela and Jasmin didn't look like the organ harvesting types, so I decided to take the risk.
								It turned out to be allright! We drove along the Garden Route towards the Addo Elephant park over a period of 3 days, making a lot of quick stops in wonderful coastal towns, lakes, forests etc. (See buttons above for some pictures). We stayed at some lovely BnB's along the way, and overall had a great experience. So we arrived in Addo(with all our organs), settled into our apartment on the park and were immediately greeted by the Vervet monkeys living in the park. As you can see in the bottom left picture. Now, I want to make something very clear: We did not feed the monkey that slice of bread. It was made very clear to us that we shouldn't feed them by a sign in the appartment that, quite dramatically, stated: "Vervet monkeys who are fed, lose their natural fear of humans and become dangerous, so they will need to be destroyed." So, wanting to find out what a 'destoyed' monkey looks like, we obviously we didn't feed it. Those monkeys are just very clever buggers, who quite certainly immediately noticed that we were new people arriving. So when we opened our balcony door and stepped out, one was in our apartment, had located our shopping bag, opened it, snatched a slice of bread and jumped out before we could say monkey. </p>

								<p>The next day in the park, we started at 6am (since that would be the time to spot lions) and we were greated by the wildlife in the Addo Elephant park. Lot's of deer, a few buffalo's, many warthogs, some zebra's, an enormous amount of Flightless Dung Beetles (which are in fact a protected species, even though we must've almost driven over hundreds of them here) and (as the name of the park might suggest), a lot of elephants. Really, seeing these african elephants so up close was really quite special. Big lumbering giants, with absolutely no concern for the cars that surround them. Which is why the header image is the last picture that I took of that particular elephant, because that did seem like the time to start backing up the car a bit. In the end, it was clear that he was just planning to walk past our car... But we were sweating it a little bit. Because if it came to a confrontation between Hedwig and an elephant, my money would be on the elephant.
								</p>
						
								<p>The weeks after that were obviously filled with more work (which I will definitely tell you some more about soon) and incidentally also with my birthday, which I celebrated with some drinks at a local craft beer place. Thanks all for the birthday wishes from the Netherlands. I had a lovely day, though it ended somewhat early. Reason for that was that, the next morning, I was bringing Pius to the airport at 4:30 since he had to be in Jo'burg for work. And I decided that that would be a good opportunity to drive through to Lion's head, a small peak in the middle of Cape Town, hike up, and watch the sunset from there. Jasmin and Jitka from Cape Town were willing to join, and, to my surprise, even two colleagues who showed up to my birthday drinks were in for it, when I suggested it literally 5 hours before they would have to get up. That hike must have been one of my highlights so far here in South Africa, along with the roadtrip. Hard to say why. I know I've been spamming you with sunset pictures for a while now, and (according to science) sunrises technically don't look very different from sunsets (except in reverse obviously). Yet still, something about looking over the city, and seeing it slowly wake up as the sun peaks from behind the mountains made a great impression on me. Pictures don't quite do it justice, though the colors are quite special I guess. </p>

									I'll leave you know with a general funny thing about South Africa, which is language. It is quite a well-known fact that South Africa has 11 official languages, more than any other country in the world. Now, in the Stellenbosch area you won't hear all eleven (nor would I be able to distinguish them) but you do hear a lot of English, Xhosa (in which the Xh is pronounced with a clicky sound, of which this language has a lot), some Zulu (which I can't really distinguish from Xhosa) and of course Afrikaans. Now, what basically every Afrikaner(native Afrikaans speaking South Africans) asks me is, 'can i understand it?': Well, yes and no. If spoken clearly, yes. But in general conversation I catch about 70%, which turns out is not quite enough to actively participate in the conversation. What's interesting about the diversity of language here is that most people will walk up to me speaking Afrikaans (since that is the most common language among white South Africans in this region) and I will basically always understand what they're saying. Obivously I can't reply in Afrikaans (I have tried doing the Dutch thing with an accent, doesn't work, people just look at me funny) but when I just reply in English, the conversation naturally progresses in English, without them even seeming to notice. That is a skill that South Africans seem to have, switching between languages without even thinking about it. They will do it among eachother as well, just speaking Afrikaans, then two or three sentences in English, before switching back to Afrikaans without missing a beat. My Dutch brain has a very hard time following that.</p> 
									<p>Also, English speaking South Africans though seem to have a particular way of speaking english to them. Some specific examples: Traffic lights are called robots (which is confusing the first few times: "Turn right at that robot", "Wait, what? ROBOT? Where?"), roundabouts are circles, 'yes' is often replaced by 'jah'. People will generally greet you with 'Howsit?', which is so common that even when I greet people with 'Hello, good day', they will very often instinctively reply 'Good, and you?'. Also, when South Africans say 'Now', they really mean some yet undefined time in the near future. When they say 'now now' it seems like they want to reinforce that they are doing it 'as soon as possible' but still doesn't mean excactly now. As in: a waiter will often say, just after taking the order "I'll bring it now now". And besides that South Africans seem to have collective expletives of saying 'hectic' and 'flippin' which I've both started to adopt...
								</p>
								<p>Wow, okay. This post is getting pretty flippin' long. So yeah, these last few weeks have been pretty hectic. And next week will be the week that my family is comiing over, so that should be fun! Will probably post something again after that. I'll begin writing now now.</p>
