<p>So, here we are! Almost three weeks later, and my blog is up! Sorry for keeping you waiting, and nice to hear that apparently people are actually quite interested in reading this! You guys might be wondering. What is this all about? Why this website? Who is this Luuk person? What is this weird language he is speaking? Then you might want to click the following button, that could provide some answers.</p>

<p>So, with that out of the way. How have my first few weeks been? Quite great to be honest! I got to see quite a bit of the beautiful country already. I've had many interesting challenges and conversations at my internship, and got to meet a whole lot of new people.So, I arrived on Tuesday morning and got picked up by Gerald, my new roommate. Gerald is a Stellenbosch University Student, doing some very clever things regarding the analysis and modification of human genomes. Besides that he is a South African native from Pretoria, who has quite succesfully positioned himself as my tourguide during the first weeks of my stay here. Right after picking me up, we enjoyed a few South African beers and saw some of town. </p>
<p><a class="image left"><img src="/images/IMG_0783.JPG" /></a>The next day was a free day for me, still recovering a little bit from a slightly tiring flight. Which gave me some room to explore some of the area on my own, while the roommates were both hard at work. My other roommate is Pius, one of my colleagues at the LaunchLab, and the man that basically got me to come to Stellenbosch in the first place. Having this day for myself exposed me to the first of many surprises a Dutchy in South Africa encounters: without a car, you really can't get very far. I was prepared for that a little bit, but still it was surprising. We live about 5km out of town, so walking isn't really a viable option. Cycling is quite impossible, considering the design of the road(that doesn't stop people from trying though, but not me (don't worry mom)) and public transport is somewhat non-existent. So that leaves Ubers, which might be slightly more expensive, but have the added benefit of allowing a nice conversation with the driver. So yeah, first day, did some exploring of Stellenbosch and found a (to me) very odd remnant of Dutch colonial times (yes, that is a Dutch flag you see there, and that is indeed the VOC symbol printed on it). I forgot to ask my tourguide what the meaning of this thing was (so Gerald, if you're reading, please remind me to ask you), but it stood out to me. </p>
<p>So after that initial wandering through Stellenbosch, I could go to work at the LaunchLab! Pius showed me around, made me meet a lot of people (seriously, I think I've said 'nice to meet you' to at least a hunderd people in the last few weeks (which is great, don't get me wrong)). I will tell you more about the work I'm doing in a future post I guess, when I don't have three weeks of experiences to catch up on ;). The weekend had a nice relaxation in the form of the Stellenbosch Wine Festival! Obviously I knew the region was known for its wines, though I had somewhat underestimated the extent to which that is noticable here. For your illustration: the winefestival had over 60 winefarms represented, all of which are from the closely surrounding area of Stellenbosch. Moreover, wine culture seems quite ingrained in the people here. Pretty much everyone seems quite knowledgable (or at least they're pretending) on wines, pretty much every student has worked on a winefarm and going on winetastings is a pretty commonplace activity. To illustrate: the following weekend I was immediately very kindly invited to the birthday of one of Gerald's friends, to do, of course, a Wine Tour! Which, besides nice wines, has views like these. So yeah, a culture of drinking wine... I'm not compaining.</p>

<p>I will definitely get into some more of the interesting cultural things I have experienced so far since I have come here. But I'm getting quite lengthy already here. So yeah, I will just share some of the pictures 'round the house! These are from the estate where we live, Welgevonden. This estate is basically a gated community with a few hundred houses. It really is a quite beautiful area, as you can see from the pictures.</p>

<p>So yeah, that's my first quick update I guess. I will definitely post a bit more often in the coming weeks, so I don't want to expand on everything too much now. So I'll just leave you with some more pictures, from a trip to the coast with roommate Gerald, and a hike with my great colleague Makabongwe. A lot of beautiful stuff, but please do also note the picture in the bottom right (click to enlarge), that is Khayelitsha, the biggest township of Cape Town with over 700.000 inhabitants (it basically stretches all the way to Table Mountain in the distance). It sadly shows the flipside of this beautiful country, and I hope that I will have some more useful things to say about that in a future post. That is it from me for now, I will speak to all of you soon. If you want to receive a reminder of that: you can leave your e-mail address behind <a href="../about.html#mail">here</a></p>
